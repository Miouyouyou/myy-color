	* Added a CHANGELOG

	* Renamed color to myy-color

	* Cleaned up myy_bmp2raw

	* Added two modules to myy-color
	- BMP which handles the decoding of BMP files
	- GL which handles the encoding of raw textures for OpenGL

	* Added a few tests that currently only test the decoding procedures.

	* Added a README which documents :
	- The current goals of the project
	- How to use the library
	- How to use myy_bmp2raw
	- What currently needs to be done.
	However a TODO file might be needed.

	* Created the gemspec file that handles the generation of the gem.
	Build the gem like this :
	`$ gem build myy-color.gemspec`

	* Modified the .gitignore file so that backup files, gem files and
	test textures are not added in the Git tree.
